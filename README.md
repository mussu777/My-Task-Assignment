## 🤔 Challenges Faced

One of the key challenges I encountered was handling **scheduled notifications** using `expo-notifications`. While the notifications work reliably when the app is in the **foreground**, their behavior in the **background** or when the app is **killed** was inconsistent.

I tried several configurations and workarounds to make them work smoothly, but due to platform-level restrictions (especially on Android), scheduled notifications would **sometimes not trigger** when the app was closed. This remains a known limitation and may require using native modules or alternate strategies in future versions.
